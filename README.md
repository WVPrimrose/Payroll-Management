# Payroll-Management

We want to create a payroll management that lets us input and view employee payroll data (First Name, Last Name, Salary)

We need to collect the employee data through various prompts and need to keep adding that information until the user tells the function to stop.

Then, we need to display the average salary in the console between all the employees that were inputed to the table.

Finally, we need to select a random employee through the array of employees inputed through the table.
